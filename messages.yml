#These are the messages most likely to be seen by the ordinary, non-administrative player.
#Feel free to customize them to your liking.
#
#Notes:
# - Some messages use special variables, such as "<amount>", "<item>" and "<cross>".
#   They represent numbers, weapon names and the multiplication sign.
# - It is good practice to surround all messages with quotes (").
# - To completely hide a message, provide an empty message. (i.e. Store_Created: "")
# - Color codes are not supported.
